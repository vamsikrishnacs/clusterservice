clusterservice
==============

An api for managing servers in a cluster with point-point and broadcast messaging


1. Implemented point-point messaging
2. Broadcast messages
3. dynamic configuration of multiple servers using a json


Usage:
--------------------
- go get github.com/vamsikrishnacs/clusterservice
- go test

Files included
--------------------
1. cluster.go(package)
2. cluster_test.go
3. config.json

Testing:
--------------------------------
- tested with many messages scenario 
- tested with broadcasting(everyone to everyone else)
- tested with round-robin message passing


package usage:
----------------------------
two functions
- New(id int,path //(.json config file) string )
- Envelope{pid int(-1 for broadcast),message}



//sample
    {server := cluster.New(myid, /* config file */"config.json")}
    
    
// the returned server object obeys the Server interface above.
  
   wait for keystroke to start.


// Let each server broadcast a message

   
   server.Outbox() <- &cluster.Envelope{Pid: cluster.BROADCAST, Msg: "hello there"} 
  
select {
       case envelope := <- case server.Inbox(): 
           fmt.Printf("Received msg from %d: '%s'\n", envelope.Pid, envelope.Msg)
  
       case <- time.After(10 * time.Second): 
           println("Waited and waited. Ab thak gaya\n")
   }


General description:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Maintains a struct object for each server
2. Uses Zeromq req/rep sockets for message passing
3. Needs a supply of configuration of list of servers and address in json format
4. An output file for the inbox of messages is created to store the messages to disk.

System check:
-----------------------------
1. No of messages sent must be equal to the no of messages received.
1. log pattern:

- msg request
- send
- got msg--(count of last msg)
- ack
- ok
